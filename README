i liked the idea of gitbutler and it's virtual branches, but it seemed to have problems working with all my other tools and seemed a bit unstable

this is probably more unstable than gitbutler, but it doesn't hide anything from you and is a purely cli tool

i am not responsible for the destruction of your repos
